        <p>
            Professional events need to be inclusive, by representing a diverse range of speakers.
            That way everybody can be involved with and inspired by the cutting edge of their field.
        </p><p>
            Too many events though don't represent any diversity <em>at all</em>.
        </p><p>
            We want to take concrete steps to fix this from the bottom up.<br/>
            We want to end totally homogeneous events,<br/>
            <strong>and we need your help.</strong>

            <p>
                By signing a pledge above, you're committing to avoid supporting or creating paid events that
                don't feature any diverse representation whatsoever. (This is a low bar for a
                reason &mdash; see the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a>.)
            </p>
            <p>
                Just promising to avoid that isn't a huge step though, on its own. If you're reading this,
                you're probably not going to fall foul of this intentionally anyway. The magic comes
                when you start actively ensuring that commitment:

                <p>
                    In many cases events will already have lineups including some diversity, so
                    should just need a quick check in practice. Most events that don't will be
                    surprised you even think that this is a risk, but just a last few won't even be
                    thinking about this at all, and won't have a plan.
                </p><p>
                    These are the events we're trying to improve. Try and nudge them in the right
                    direction, and if they need any help and tips, show them the "Organizing an Event?"
                    section under <a href="#resources">resources</a>.

            </details>

            <p>
                Each step here builds a culture that makes it unacceptable for an event to
                ignore diversity, as too many do (<a href="http://allmalepanels.tumblr.com/">some</a>
                <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/02/24/female-chemists-protest-all-male-conference-lineup">
                illustrative</a>
                <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/07/tory-conference-fringe-events-all-male-panels">examples</a>).
                Remember, of course, that not all diversity is visible: give events a chance to explain
                where they stand and what they're doing before you reject them.
            </p><p>
                When organizers have big groups of speakers warn them they'll have to
                drop out if they don't have any speaker diversity, and whole batches of attendees
                asking them to confirm that in advance, it stops being possible to ignore the issue.
                With an embarassingly low bar it's hard to argue it's ok.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take a concrete step on diversity, help shut down the worst offenders,
                and make it inconceivable to run a paid event that ignores its responsibilities.<br/>

                <p>
                    Spread the word! Share the pledge around, tell conferences and your employer and
                    your friends about it, and help us get as many people involved as possible, so
                    we can make maximum impact.

            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Why is this important?</summary>
                <p>
                    As well as helping and inspiring individual people from underrepresented groups,
                    increasing speaker diversity is important because <strong>diverse groups solve
                    problems better</strong>.
                    <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/">
                    We've done studies</a>, it's measurably true, and aiming for a diverse mix of genders,
                    races, religions, sexualities &amp; more everywhere makes us all more successful,
                    and the world a better place.
                </p><p>
                    This is important in communities generally, but especially for people in leading
                    role-model positions, such as speakers at industry events. More diverse groups of
                    speakers will give us conference talks and discussion with a wider range of
                    ideas, but more importantly will also include &amp; inspire more diverse audiences
                    in turn.
                </p><p>
                    It's this multiplier effect that's key. More diverse lineups let everybody get
                    involved in the cutting-edge of the field, help spread diversity in the
                    community as a whole, and hopefully inspire more diverse groups of people to
                    share their ideas on stage too.
                </p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>Why a minimum bar?</summary>
                <p>
                    By focusing on the minimum level, <strong>we hope to get as many people
                    as possible involved</strong>. If it becomes a common sight for organizers
                    everywhere, <strong>nobody can run events that totally ignore diversity</strong>.
                    The pledge can't rule out the majority of existing events, or it simply wouldn't be
                    practical. We need to focus first on the clear worst offenders, and build up from there.
                </p><p>
                    The hope here is that this will cause big problems for those below the minimum
                    bar, and the steady pressure from many pledge signers mentioning it when accepting
                    speaking slots and buying tickets will highlight diversity further, even among events
                    already reaching this line. This builds awareness and momentum across the board to improve
                    diversity even further, everywhere.
                </p><p>
                    This is just the start though. <strong>You personally don't need to limit yourself to
                    this minimal bar</strong>, and we'd definitely encourage you to go even further. (See
                    <a href="#resources">resources</a> for some suggestions). In future we also hope to
                    extend beyond this, to steadily raise the bar and improve diversity more and more.
                    For now though this pledge is focused on taking a pragmatic and immediate step forward,
                    with a long road ahead.

                    <strong>Diversity is important, and every event should have a diverse lineup.</strong>
                    Many free events are tiny meetups organized by volunteers though, with tiny lineups,
                    and barely enough time or resources to actively find <em>any</em> speakers, let
                    alone go further and encourage diverse speakers. (See <a href="#resources">resources</a>
                    for some tips on doing this.) These events do need to be more inclusive too,
                    but outright boycotts across the board would rule out many events that can't
                    easily invest more effort to go further. Including these events in this pledge would
                    make it impossible for many people to sign up.
                </p><p>
                    Events that charge for entry are a different matter: <strong>any event
                    large &amp; successful enough to charge for tickets has the power to provide an inclusive
                    environment, and a responsibility to do so</strong>. These events need to be investing
                    some of their revenue and time back into their speaker selection to guarantee at
                    least a minimum level of diversity, and many aren't. This is where we're focusing.
                </p><p>
                    <strong>You personally don't have to limit this to only paid events</strong>
                    though. This is the minimum general bar, but do feel free to go further
                    and push for more! (See <a href="#resources">resources</a> if you'd like
                    some ideas for ways to do that.)

                <summary>What do you mean by 'diverse' speakers?</summary>
                <p>
                    The short answer: <strong>it depends, but the key is to highlight a range of voices
                    from a variety of backgrounds, especially those who aren't normally heard.</strong>
                </p><p>
                    Diversity is a complicated topic, and it's going to depend on the context. You may
                    have to make your own call on this. Not all diversity is visible: many disabilities
                    have no physical manifestation and you cannot tell if a person is LGBT just from
                    appearance. However, a lack of visible diversity is a very clear indicator that an event
                    is not considering diversity at all. It is the clearly failing cases that this pledge
                    is most concerned with. When your whole lineup is white men, there's a clear problem.
                    If you have a lineup that instead includes some women, people of color, LGBT people,
                    and people with disabilities, you've gained some level of diversity.
                </p><p>
                    Existing represention of the groups in question is key. The
                    groups to focus on are those who are otherwise frequently discriminated against,
                    and are different to the typical speakers you'd see at your event. Adding
                    somebody British to a lineup of Americans typically doesn't add any meaningful
                    diversity. Adding somebody from Latin America often would.

                <summary>What if I'm a speaker from an underrepresented group?</summary>
                <p>
                    For white male speakers, the speaker pledge is often relevant and actionable.
                    It's less relevant as a speaker from an underrepresented group though, as
                    bringing your own voice to an event often increases the diversity of speakers
                    automatically. (That's not always the case! There are occasional instances of
                    problematic lineups including only the voices of cis white women, for example,
                    but it's a much less frequent issue than the classic
                    <a href="http://allmalepanels.tumblr.com/">all-white-male panel</a>.)
                </p><p>
                    For some of us who are ourselves underrepresented, it may feel like we'll
                    never be a member of a homogeneous group of speakers, and this pledge won't
                    matter. These pledges exist though because never seeing people like yourself up on
                    stage sucks, and without the support of the people we're trying to help, they're
                    meaningless. If you're from an underrepresented group, we need your help to
                    create better events:
                </p><ul>
                    <li>Sign the speaker pledge anyway to show your support.</li>
                    <li>Sign the attendee pledge, and refuse to attend events that completely ignore diversity.</li>
                    <li>Encourage both your company and the events you go to sign the company and event pledges.</li>

                <summary>Aren't there existing pledges for this?</summary>
                <p>
                    There are quite a few other related pledges. Many of these are more narrowly
                    focused aimed at a specific field or part of world. Some commit you to general
                    rather than concrete action, or look only at panel lineups, rather than whole
                    conferences. Many focus only on including female speakers, rather than encouraging
                    diversity as a whole (an easy way to leave many
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/Mia_theGreat/status/777881337919221760">other</a>

                    Those other pledges have value, but they're not doing exactly what we want to do here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal of this pledge is to help people take <strong>specific concrete action</strong>
                    to solve the diversity problem that appears in professional events of <strong>all sorts of
                    fields, all around the world, for everybody</strong>. As far as we're aware, this is the only
                    pledge doing that.

                <summary>What will you do with signups?</summary>
                <p>
                    Mainly just publish how many of them we get, so everybody can see how many
                    people think this is important.
                </p><p>
                    The pledges also ask you for your name (or your company/event's name and logo).
                    We're planning to eventually publish a list of the people who've signed up, and
                    include a selection of event and company logos on the site. There is an option in
                    the pledge to sign it but opt out of having your name published, if you'd
                    prefer.
                </p><p>
                    Finally, we also collect email addresses (again, optionally). We'll never share these or
                    spam them. They're only going to be used for very occasional later updates closely
                    related to this pledge.

                    Approach speakers from underrepresented backgrounds. Talk to organizations
                    representing underrepresented groups in your industry and see if they can suggest
                    speakers, and look for speakers from varied backgrounds in the lineups of other
                    conferences in your field. If you get stuck, here's some pre-compiled
