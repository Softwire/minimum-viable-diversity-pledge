        <p>
            Professional events need to be inclusive, by representing a diverse range of speakers.
            That way everybody can be involved with and inspired by the cutting edge of their field.
        </p><p>
            Too many events though don't represent any diversity <em>at all</em>.
        </p><p>
            We want to take concrete steps to fix this from the bottom up.<br/>
            We want to end totally homogeneous events,<br/>
            <strong>and we need your help.</strong>

            <p>
                By signing a pledge above, you're committing to not supporting or creating paid events that
                don't feature any diverse representation whatsoever (this is a low bar for a
                reason: see the <a href="#faq">FAQ</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
                Just promising not to do that isn't a huge step though, on its own. If you're reading this,
                you're probably not going to fall foul of this intentionally anyway. The magic comes
                when you start actively ensuring that commitment:

                    When confirming your slot at an event, include a note like:

                    I won't be able to speak <em>[at this event/on this panel]</em> if every
                    other speaker you pick is a <em>[man/cis woman/white person]</em> like me.
                    Let me know if that's going to be a problem; I'd be happy to help you find
                    speakers from underrepresented groups.

                <p>
                    In most cases this will be enough (and many events will be surprised you even

                Each step here builds a culture that makes it unacceptable for an event to
                ignore diversity, as too many do (<a href="http://allmalepanels.tumblr.com/">some</a>

            </p><p>
                When organizers have big groups of speakers warn them they'll have to
                drop out if they don't have any speaker diversity, and whole batches of attendees
                asking them to confirm that in advance, it stops being possible to ignore the issue.
                With an embarassingly low bar it's hard to argue it's ok.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take a concrete step on diversity, help shut down the worst offenders,
                and make it inconceivable to run a paid event that ignores its responsibilities.<br/>

                    Spread the word! Share the pledge around, tell conferences and your employer and
                    your friends about it, and help us get as many people involved as possible, so
                    we can make maximum impact.

                <summary>Why is this important?</summary>
                <p>
                    <strong>Diverse groups solve problems better</strong>.
                    <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/">
                    We've done studies</a>, it's measurably true, and aiming for a diverse mix of genders,
                    races, religions, sexualities &amp; more everywhere makes us all more successful,
                    and the world a better place.
                </p><p>
                    This is important in communities generally, but especially for people in leading
                    role-model positions, such as speakers at industry events. More diverse groups of
                    speakers will give us conference talks and discussion with a wider range of
                    ideas, but more importantly will also include &amp; inspire more diverse audiences.
                </p><p>
                    It's this multiplier effect that's key. More diverse lineups let everybody get
                    involved in the cutting-edge of the field, help spread diversity in the
                    community as a whole, and hopefully inspire more diverse groups of people to
                    share their ideas on stage too.

                <summary>Why a minimum bar?</summary>
                <p>
                    By focusing on the minimum level, <strong>we want to get as many people
                    as possible involved, so that it becomes a common sight for organizers
                    everywhere, so nobody can run events that totally ignore diversity</strong>. If
                    you want to make a concrete pledge to solve a widespread issue that's also practical
                    for as many people as possible to sign up to, you can't rule out the majority
                    of existing events. You need to focus first on the clear worst offenders, and
                    build up from there.
                </p><p>
                    The hope here is that this will cause big problems for those below the minimum
                    bar, and in addition the steady pressure from many pledge signers mentioning it
                    when accepting speaking slots and buying tickets will highlight diversity further,
                    even among events already reaching this line. This builds awareness and momentum
                    across the board to improve diversity even further, everywhere.
                </p><p>
                    This is just the start though. <strong>You personally don't need to limit yourself to
                    pushing for this minimal bar</strong>, and we'd encourage you to go even further
                    (see <a href="#resources">resources</a> for some suggestions).
                    In future we also hope to extend beyond this, to steadily raise the bar
                    and improve diversity more and more. For now though this pledge is focused
                    on taking a practical and immediate step forward, with a long road ahead.

            <details>
                <summary>Why only paid events?</summary>
                <p>
                    <strong>Diversity is important, and every event should have a diverse lineup.</strong>
                    Many free events are tiny meetups organized by volunteers though, with tiny lineups,
                    and barely enough time or resources to actively find <em>any</em> speakers, let
                    alone go further and encourage diverse speakers (see <a href="#resources">resources</a>
                    for some tips on doing this). These events do need to be more inclusive too,
                    but outright boycotts across the board for these rules out many events that can't
                    easily invest more effort to go further. Including these events in this pledge
                    makes it impossible for many people to sign up.
                </p><p>
                    Events that charge for entry are a different matter: <strong>any event
                    large &amp; successful enough to charge for tickets has the power to provide an inclusive
                    environment, and a responsibility to do so</strong>. These events need to be investing
                    some of their revenue and time back into their speaker selection to guarantee at
                    least a minimum level of gender diversity, and many aren't. This is where we're focusing.
                </p><p>
                    <strong>You personally don't have to limit this to only paid events</strong>
                    though. This is the minimum general bar: feel free to go further
                    and push for more (and see <a href="#resources">resources</a> if you'd like
                    some ideas for ways to do that).
                </p>
            </details>

            <details>
                <summary>What do you mean by 'diverse' speakers?</summary>
                <p>
                    The short answer: <strong>it depends, but the key is to highlight a range of voices
                    from a variety of backgrounds, especially those who aren't normally heard.</strong>
                </p><p>
                    Diversity is a complicated topic, and it's going to depend on the context. You may
                    have to make your own call on this. Most of the time though it's pretty
                    clear when you have no meaningful diversity at all, and it's the clearly failing cases
                    that this pledge is most concerned with. When your whole lineup is white men, there's a
                    clear problem. If you have a lineup that instead includes some women, people of color,
                    LGBT people, and people with disabilities, you've gained some level of diversity.
                </p><p>
                    Existing represention of the groups in question is key. The
                    groups to focus on are those who are otherwise frequently discriminated against,
                    and are different to the typical speakers you'd see at your event. Adding
                    somebody British to a lineup of Americans typically doesn't add any meaningful
                    diversity. Adding somebody from Latin America often would.

                <summary>What if I'm a speaker from an underrepresented group?</summary>
                <p>
                    For white male speakers, the speaker pledge is often relevant and actionable.
                    It's less relevant as a speaker from an underrepresented group though, as
                    bringing your own voice to an event often increases the diversity of speakers
                    automatically. That's not always the case; there are occasional instances of
                    problematic lineups including only the voices of cis white women, for example,
                    but it's a much less frequent issue than the classic
                    <a href="http://allmalepanels.tumblr.com/">all-white-male panel</a>.
                </p><p>
                    There are some people however that in today's world are never a member of
                    a homogeneous group of speakers. If you're in this position, the speaker pledge
                    is a commitment that you'd struggle to break. Feel free to sign it anyway to show
                    your support, or to sign one of the other pledges, which are still just as
                    relevant.
                </p><p>
                    If this sounds like you, and you'd like to go further and help improve diversity
                    in speaker lineups directly, consider adding your name to the list of

                <summary>Aren't there existing pledges for this?</summary>
                <p>
                    There are quite a few other related pledges. Many of these are more narrowly
                    focused aimed at a specific field or part of world. Some commit you to general
                    rather than concrete action, or look only at panel lineups, rather than whole
                    conferences. Many focus only on including female speakers, rather than encouraging
                    diversity as a whole (an easy way to leave many
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/Mia_theGreat/status/777881337919221760">other</a>
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/alexstran/status/763079375013031936">underrepresented</a>

                    <a href="https://twitter.com/laurenarankin/status/380155913845219328">excluded</a>).
                    This isn't to say other pledges don't have value, but they're not doing exactly
                    what we want to do here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The goal is this pledge is to help people take specific concrete action to solve
                    the diversity problem that appears in professional events of all sorts of fields,
                    all around the world, for everybody. As far as we're aware, this is the only
                    pledge doing that.

                <summary>What will you do with signups?</summary>
                <p>
                    Mainly just publish how many of them we get, so everybody can see how many
                    people think this is important.
                </p><p>
                    The pledges also ask you for your name (or your company/event's name and logo).
                    We're planning to eventually publish a list of the people who've signed up, and
                    include a selection of event and company logos on the site. There is an option in
                    the pledge to sign it but opt out of having your name published, if you'd
                    prefer.
                </p><p>
                    Finally, we also (optionally) collect email addresses. We'll never share these or
                    spam them. They're only going to be used for very occasional later updates closely
                    related to this pledge.

                    Approach speakers from underrepresented backgrounds. Talk to organizations
                    representing underrepresented groups in your industry and see if they can suggest
                    speakers, and look for speakers from varied backgrounds in the lineups of other
                    conferences in your field. If you get stuck, here's some pre-compiled
